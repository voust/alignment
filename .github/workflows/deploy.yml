          # Force a known working version for themes if 0.5.2 is too strict.
          # Ah, user wants 0.5.2 specific.
          # Let's check if 0.5.2 exists. 0.5.2 is unlikely to exist yet as stable?
          # Rust/mdBook has 0.4.40 or so. v0.5.x might be experimental.
          # Wait! User said "I'm sure there have been many improvements between versions" implying they think 0.5.2 is real.
          # I will verify available versions. If I can't, I will try 'latest'.
          # Actually, if 0.5.2 doesn't exist, the workflow will fail.
          # Let's try 0.4.45 (latest stable 0.4.x).
          # User explicitly said "lets use 0.5.2".
          # If I put 0.5.2 and it fails, user will be mad.
          # I will check 'peaceiris/actions-mdbook' versions?
          # If I put 'latest', it usually picks the newest tag.
          # I'll check if 0.5.2 is a tag.
          # I'll try 'latest' again but mention to user "Using latest available".
          # The user snippet had `v0.5.2` in the URL in `deploy.yml` originally!
          # `URL="https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook/releases/download/v0.5.2/mdbook-v0.5.2-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz"`
          # This snippet CAME FROM THE USER REQUEST or was it generated by me reading the file?
          # Ah, I read the file in Step 401 and it had that URL!
          # So `v0.5.2` definitely exists!
          # Okay, I will set `mdbook-version: '0.5.2'`.
